# A-002 Koivos.NET   

### Introduction

κοινος in Greek means "mutual". This repository will include all .NET examples made by members of Pinoy I.T. Geeks for Pinoy IT Students/ Developers.

### Goals

* Object-oriented
* Properly documented (in Filipino)
* To learn source-control along the way (GIT)


### Directory Structure

There will be two main directories - Common and Examples. Reusable class libraries will be located in Common
while implementation to demonstrate the usage of it will be in the Examples folder.

Under each directory will have a sub-folder named after what version of Visual Studio it is made.
```
FORMAT: /Common/src/{vs_version}/{language} | /Examples/{example_number}/{vs_version}/{language}
```

Example:
```
/Common/src/2012/cs/Common.sln
/Common/src/2010/vb/Common.sln

/Examples/001-LoginForm/2012/cs/LoginForm.sln
/Examples/001-LoginForm/2010/vb/LoginForm.sln
```

In terms of .NET framework, the following directory structure should be followed for the binaries:
```
FORMAT: /Common/bin/{framework_version}
```

Example:
```
/Common/bin/2.0
/Common/bin/3.5
/Common/bin/4.0
```
